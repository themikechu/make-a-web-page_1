          <p>
            A <b>person</b> uses a <b>computer</b> which communicates with <b>servers</b> using <em>HTTP</em>. From their communication, the <b>server</b> then sends information back to the<b>computer</b>. The <b>web browser</b> is how this is viewed.

        Inline and Block
        <div class="supporting">
          <p>
            Block elements have a "box around them." Inline elements do not start a new line and can be examples like <strong>strong</strong> which puts an emphasis on text.

        Computers are stupid!
        <div class="supporting">
          <p>
            We also learned that if you have an error in your code, you computer does not fix it on it's own. The computer will follow the directions that you give it.

          Ways to Have CSS
          <div class="supporting">
            <ol>
              <li>Write CSS into the "head of your HTML"</li>
              <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS file (place link in head)</li>
              <li>Write your style inline. This leads to alot of repeated code.</li>
            </ol>

          Repetition
          <div class="supporting">
            <p>
              If you can create an organized structure, with code grouped into classes, then you can affect different aspects of code with changes in the CSS. This helps to minimize the amount of repetition and amount of code.
